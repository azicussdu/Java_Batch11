Access modifiers. Access modifiers
we can use for class, for fields, methods and constructors.

For classes we can use one of two access modifiers: public and default.

If your class has access modifier = public. Then you can create object
of this class from anywhere in your project
 */

/*
If you remove public access modifier, so now your class
has access modifier = default.
In java default = package-private.
