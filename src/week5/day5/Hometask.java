        Just need to do some modification
        in our project from Map_dictionary.java file.

        - For menu #2, If he enters the same translation that we had
        in our dictionary then print the message:
        "The new translation is the same as old one".
        After he normally has to choose menu #2 again and
        again try to enter a new translation.

        - For menu #3. If there are no words added yet into dictionary
        then just print message "Dictionary is empty".
        You can do it using isEmpty() or size() methods of TreeMap class.

        - For menu #4. If the word entered does not exist in our
        dictionary so ask the user if he wants to add it?
        if user inputs "yes" then ask for its translation and after
        add it to the dictionary. If user inputs "no", then ignore.

        - For menu #5. If he wants to remove a word that does not
        exist in our dictionary then print message "No such word in a dictionary".
