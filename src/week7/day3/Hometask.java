    class Food:
        String name; (if you want also can validate)
        int price (only positive number);

    class Menu:
        String restaurantName;
        ArrayList<Food> foodList = ...

    For those two class provide getter/setter, constructor(at least 1 constructor),
    toString(). Do data validation in setter methods. Test it after.

    !!! Hanna - Do not use GENERATE MENU :))) This week try to do it manually!!!
